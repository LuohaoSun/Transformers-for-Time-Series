# TimeGPT is a production ready, generative pretrained transformer for time series.
# It's capable of accurately predicting various domains such as retail, electricity,
# finance, and IoT with just a few lines of code ðŸš€.
# For more details, please refer to https://github.com/Nixtla/nixtla?tab=readme-ov-file

# To use TimeGPT, you need to install the Nixtla library:
# pip install nixtla

            - time_col:
                Column name in `df` that contains the time indices of the time series. This is typically a datetime
                column with regular intervals, e.g., hourly, daily, monthly data points.
            - target_col:
                Column name in `df` that contains the target variable of the time series, i.e., the variable we
                wish to predict or analyze.
            Additionally, you can pass multiple time series (stacked in the dataframe) considering an additional column:
            - id_col:
                Column name in `df` that identifies unique time series. Each unique value in this column
                corresponds to a unique time series.
